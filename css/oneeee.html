          Java is a programming <strong>HTML</strong>language and computing
          platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It has evolved
          from humble beginnings to power a large share of today’s digital
          world, by providing the reliable platform upon which many
          <i> services </i> and applications are built. New, innovative products
          and digital services designed for the future continue to rely on Java,
          as well.
