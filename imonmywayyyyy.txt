I'm sorry but I do the blame

[Music]

they don't understand

when I'm finished I'm about my business

and ready to save the world I'm taking

on this

make it my gonna be everyone's

favorite

[Music]

nobody but me can keep me safe

[Music]

Shanta mojo

[Music]

and when I came out I saw

Tommy and so you mono kiku know where

kurama forget me

nothing on my casa like it

let me prepare for me--not Sangeeta

lejos their day

[Music]

nobody but me can keep me safe

[Music]

[Music]

everybody

[Music]

everybody

[Music]

[Music]

me

[Music]

I'm on my way
